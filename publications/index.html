Although various attempts have been proposed to overcome limitations in acquiring labeled molecules, the previous pre-training methods still rely on semantic subgraphs, i.e., functional groups. Only focusing on the functional groups could overlook the graph-level distinctions. The key challenge to build a pre-trained GNN on molecules is how to (1) generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and (2) automatically discover the functional groups without prior knowledge. To solve it, we propose a novel Subgraph-conditioned Graph Information Bottleneck, named S-CGIB, for pre-training GNNs to recognize core subgraphs (graph cores) and significant subgraphs. The main idea is that the graph cores contain compressed and sufficient information that could generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and reconstruct the input graph conditioned on significant subgraphs across molecules under the S-CGIB principle. To discover significant subgraphs without prior knowledge about functional groups, we propose generating a set of functional group candidates, i.e., ego networks, and using an attention-based interaction between the graph core and the candidates. Despite being identified from self-supervised learning, our learned subgraphs match the real-world functional groups. Extensive experiments on molecule datasets across various domains demonstrate the superiority of S-CGIB.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">IEEE Access</abbr> </div> <div id="Ho2024118406" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Face Detection Using Eigenfaces: A Comprehensive Review</div> <div class="author"> Huu-Tuong Ho , Luong Vuong Nguyen , Tra Le Thi Huong , and <em>O-Joun Lee</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Access</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3435964" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper thoroughly reviews face detection techniques, primarily focusing on applying Eigenfaces, a powerful method rooted in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the advancements, challenges, and prospects associated with Eigenface-based face detection systems. The review commences with exploring the comprehensive facial recognition system framework using Eigenfaces and studying the intricacies of employing Eigenfaces as a foundational element for robust facial recognition. Then, we describe the taxonomies of various Eigenface-based face detection approaches to provide a systematic understanding of the diverse strategies utilized in Eigenface-based face detection systems.

We examine the effectiveness of this approach when the electrical data for neural networks is scarce and costly and when the electrical characteristics to be modeled are highly non-linear. By using technology computer-aided design simulations, we constructed a dataset of the electrical characteristics of organic field-effect transistors with Gaussian disorder that exhibit highly non-linear current-voltage curves. Subsequently, we developed neural compact models by modifying conventional deep learning models and validated the effectiveness of transfer learning with testing through various experiments.

Consuming iron oxide-contaminated water can cause significant health issues such as gastrointestinal infections, dermatological problems, and lymph node complications. Therefore, non-destructive and continuous monitoring of pipe corrosion is imperative for water sustainability initiatives. This study introduces a dual-mode methodology utilizing advanced ultrasound technology and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to quantify pipe corrosion. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) employs high-frequency ultrasound to generate high-resolution images of pipe thickness, indicating iron oxide accumulation. SAM also captures internal pipe data to measure iron oxide concentration in the water. This data, analyzed by CNN, achieves an impressive 95% accuracy. This dual-mode system effectively assesses both the extent of pipe corrosion and water contamination, exemplifying the successful integration of SAM and CNN for precise and reliable monitoring. © The Author(s) 2024.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">AAAI</abbr> </div> <div id="Hoang202412456" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Transitivity-Preserving Graph Representation Learning for Bridging Local Connectivity and Role-Based Similarity</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/hoangvanthuy90" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Van Thuy Hoang</a>, and <em>O-Joun Lee</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1609/aaai.v38i11.29138" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Graph representation learning (GRL) methods, such as graph neural networks and graph transformer models, have been successfully used to analyze graph-structured data, mainly focusing on node classification and link prediction tasks. However, the existing studies mostly only consider local connectivity while ignoring long-range connectivity and the roles of nodes. In this paper, we propose Unified Graph Transformer Networks (UGT) that effectively integrate local and global structural information into fixed-length vector representations. First, UGT learns local structure by identifying the local substructures and aggregating features of the k-hop neighborhoods of each node. Second, we construct virtual edges, bridging distant nodes with structural similarity to capture the long-range dependencies. Third, UGT learns unified representations through self-attention, encoding structural distance and p-step transition probability between node pairs. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning task that effectively learns transition probability to fuse local and global structural features, which could then be transferred to other downstream tasks. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets over various downstream tasks showed that UGT significantly outperformed baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models. In addition, UGT reaches the third-order Weisfeiler-Lehman power to distinguish non-isomorphic graph pairs.

Thus, the quantitative analysis of observation impacts is crucial for the effective and efficient development of weather forecasting systems. However, existing impact analysis methods are dependent on specific forecast systems, because system-specific adjoint models are used and the sensitivity of the observation to the forecast is measured. This study investigates the impact of observations on atmospheric state estimation in weather forecasting systems by developing a novel graph neural network (GNN) model specialized for analyzing the heterogeneous relations between observations and atmospheric states. The observation impact can then be assessed by applying explainable methods to the proposed GNN model, which is independent of forecasting systems. Further, we develop a novel application called ‘CloudNine,’ a system that provides impact analysis for individual observations with visualization. Our GNN model comprises hierarchical message-passing modules that separately analyze spatial correlations between observations at close locations and atmospheric states at close locations and then examine correlations between observations and atmospheric states. To consider the different factors influencing these correlations, we utilized geo-coordinates and types of observations in the attention mechanism of the modules with their feature vectors. We then applied gradient-based explainability methods to quantify the significance of the different observations in the estimation. Evaluated using data from 11 satellites and land-based observations, the results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model and the visualization of observation impacts, enhancing the understanding and optimization of observational data in weather forecasting. © 2024 The Author(s).

Recommendation systems only work well in some data-rich areas (industries). Therefore, it is unsuitable for kiosk systems with multiple domains and data imbalances, and it is challenging to collect detailed information such as user reviews and product descriptions. In this paper, we propose a context-aware hyper-personalized recommendation system that utilizes context information collected from kiosk IoT devices, minimizes the model size of the kiosk device, and aims for consistent performance and high recommendation performance in various domains. We also developed effective self-supervised learning to increase data learning efficiency in data imbalance environments. The quality of products recommended by the proposed kiosk recommendation system was evaluated using transactions that occurred in an actual kiosk system. As a result, compared to the existing recommendation system, all performance indicators improved by an average of 20%. When the self-supervised learning method was additionally applied, it improved by an average of 0.8% more. In particular, it shows superior performance regarding the quality of recommended items and resource usage according to users.

One application is diagnosing diseases by using ultrasound signals to analyze the physical properties contained in the signals. Dysnatremia, which can result in severe consequences to health such as stroke and cardiovascular disease, can be measured using blood sodium tests. However, these tests are performed by drawing blood, and obtaining the results requires a considerable amount of time. In addition, it has low reliability because the results vary depending on the inspection equipment and inspection method. In this study, we propose a novel approach for the quantification of dysnatremia using a single-beam acoustic microbeam (SBAM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A 90 MHz transducer was fabricated and used to obtain reflected signals from red blood cells (RBCs), which are affected by the shape of the cells which, in turn, depend on the sodium concentration. Blood samples with varying sodium chloride concentrations were tested, and the reflected signals were analyzed using a CNN, for automation as opposed to manual analysis. The accuracy of the classification of the blood samples into 10 and 5-level groups, based on the sodium chloride concentration, was 0.961 and 0.942, respectively, as determined using CNNs. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of SBAM and CNN technologies for efficient quantification of sodium concentration in blood. This technology will help to diagnose dysnatremia in a non-invasive way with reduced analysis time and high accuracy.

Although current methods exist, these have certain limitations, such as low reliability and accuracy, difficulty in individual patient adjustment, and discomfort during use. This paper presents a novel approach for diagnosing diabetes using high-frequency ultrasound (HFU) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). This method is based on the observation that glucose in red blood cells (RBCs) forms glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and accumulates on its surface. The study incubated RBCs with different glucose concentrations, collected acoustic reflection signals from them using a custom-designed 90-MHz transducer, and analyzed the signals using a CNN. The CNN was applied to the frequency spectra and spectrograms of the signal to identify correlations between changes in RBC properties owing to glucose concentration and signal features. The results confirmed the efficacy of the CNN-based approach with a classification accuracy of 0.98. This non-invasive diagnostic technology using HFU and CNN holds promise for in vivo diagnosis without the need for blood collection. © 2023</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">BMC Med Img</abbr> </div> <div id="Park2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automated classification of liver fibrosis stages using ultrasound imaging</div> <div class="author"> Hyun-Cheol Park , YunSang Joo , <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, Kunkyu Lee , Tai-Kyong Song , <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/phdchangchoi/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chang Choi</a> , Moon Hyung Choi , and Changhan Yoon </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>BMC Medical Imaging</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1186/s12880-024-01209-4" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Background: Ultrasound imaging is the most frequently performed for the patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. However, ultrasound imaging is highly operator dependent and interpretation of ultrasound images is subjective, thus well-trained radiologist is required for evaluation. Automated classification of liver fibrosis could alleviate the shortage of skilled radiologist especially in low-to-middle income countries. The purposed of this study is to evaluate deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for classifying the degree of liver fibrosis according to the METAVIR score using US images. Methods: We used ultrasound (US) images from two tertiary university hospitals. A total of 7920 US images from 933 patients were used for training/validation of DCNNs. All patient were underwent liver biopsy or hepatectomy, and liver fibrosis was categorized based on pathology results using the METAVIR score. Five well-established DCNNs (VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet and ViT) was implemented to predict the METAVIR score. The performance of DCNNs for five-level (F0/F1/F2/F3/F4) classification was evaluated through area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidential interval, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio. Results: Similar mean AUC values were achieved for five models; VGGNet (0.96), ResNet (0.96), DenseNet (0.95), EfficientNet (0.96), and ViT (0.95). The same mean accuracy (0.94) and specificity values (0.96) were yielded for all models. In terms of sensitivity, EffcientNet achieved highest mean value (0.85) while the other models produced slightly lower values range from 0.82 to 0.84. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that DCNNs can classify the staging of liver fibrosis according to METAVIR score with high performance using conventional B-mode images. Among them, EfficientNET that have fewer parameters and computation cost produced highest performance. From the results, we believe that DCNNs based classification of liver fibrosis may allow fast and accurate diagnosis of liver fibrosis without needs of additional equipment for add-on test and may be powerful tool for supporting radiologists in clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2024.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">EACL</abbr> </div> <div id="Park20231112" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">“Why do I feel offended?’ Korean Dataset for Offensive Language Identification</div> <div class="author"> San-Hee Park , Kang-Min Kim , <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, Youjin Kang , Jaewon Lee , Su-Min Lee , and SangKeun Lee </div> <div class="periodical"> 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-pmid="" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Offensive content is an unavoidable issue on social media. Most existing offensive language identification methods rely on the compilation of labeled datasets. However, existing methods rarely consider low-resource languages that have relatively less data available for training (e.g., Korean). To address these issues, we construct a novel KOrean Dataset for Offensive Language Identification (KODOLI). KODOLI comprises more fine-grained offensiveness categories (i.e., not offensive, likely offensive, and offensive) than existing ones. A likely offensive language refers to texts with implicit offensiveness or abusive language without offensive intentions. In addition, we propose two auxiliary tasks to help identify offensive languages: abusive language detection and sentiment analysis. We provide experimental results for baselines on KODOLI and observe that pre-trained language models suffer from identifying "LIKELY" offensive statements. Quantitative results and qualitative analysis demonstrate that jointly learning offensive language, abusive language and sentiment information improves the performance of offensive language identification. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Sensors</abbr> </div> <div id="Hoang2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Graph Representation Learning and Its Applications: A Survey</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/hoangvanthuy90" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Van Thuy Hoang</a>, <a href="https://higd963.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hyeon-Ju Jeon</a>, <a href="https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/esyou" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eun-Soon You</a>, Yoewon Yoon , <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sungyeopjung" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sungyeop Jung</a>, and <em>O-Joun Lee</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Sensors</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.3390/s23084168" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Graphs are data structures that effectively represent relational data in the real world. Graph representation learning is a significant task since it could facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, etc. Graph representation learning aims to map graph entities to low-dimensional vectors while preserving graph structure and entity relationships. Over the decades, many models have been proposed for graph representation learning. This paper aims to show a comprehensive picture of graph representation learning models, including traditional and state-of-the-art models on various graphs in different geometric spaces. First, we begin with five types of graph embedding models: graph kernels, matrix factorization models, shallow models, deep-learning models, and non-Euclidean models. In addition, we also discuss graph transformer models and Gaussian embedding models. Second, we present practical applications of graph embedding models, from constructing graphs for specific domains to applying models to solve tasks. Finally, we discuss challenges for existing models and future research directions in detail. As a result, this paper provides a structured overview of the diversity of graph embedding models. © 2023 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">IEEE Access</abbr> </div> <div id="Hoang2023114238" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Companion Animal Disease Diagnostics Based on Literal-Aware Medical Knowledge Graph Representation Learning</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/hoangvanthuy90" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Van Thuy Hoang</a> , Thanh Sang Nguyen , Sangmyeong Lee , Jooho Lee , <a href="https://luongvuongnguyen.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Luong Vuong Nguyen</a>, and <em>O-Joun Lee</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Access</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3324046" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Knowledge graph (KG) embedding has been used to benefit the diagnosis of animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile, the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally, we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models. © 2023 The Authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">RACS</abbr> </div> <div id="Gaurav2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) based Stock Price Prediction</div> <div class="author"> Akshat Gaurav , Varsha Arya , Kwok Tai Chui , Brij B.

In recent years, deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promising results in capturing complex temporal dependencies and forecasting time series data. This research paper presents a LSTM-based framework for stock price prediction. The proposed framework utilizes historical stock price data. The LSTM model is designed to learn the underlying patterns and trends in the data, enabling it to make accurate predictions of future stock prices. We preprocess the data, including normalization and feature engineering, to enhance the model’s ability to extract meaningful patterns. We employ appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), to assess the accuracy of the predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM-based framework achieves competitive performance in stock price prediction compared to traditional statistical models and other machine learning approaches. © 2023 ACM.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">IEEE Access</abbr> </div> <div id="Joo20239920" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Classification of Liver Fibrosis From Heterogeneous Ultrasound Image</div> <div class="author"> Yunsang Joo , Hyun-Cheol Park , <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, Changhan Yoon , Moon Hyung Choi , and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/phdchangchoi/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chang Choi</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Access</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240216" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>With the advances in deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), automated diagnosis technology using medical images has received considerable attention in medical science. In particular, in the field of ultrasound imaging, CNN trains the features of organs through an amount of image data, so that an expert-level automatic diagnosis is possible only with images of actual patients. However, CNN models are also trained on the features that reflect the inherent bias of the imaging machine used for image acquisition. In other words, when the domain of data used for training is different from that of data applied for an actual diagnosis, it is unclear whether consistent performance can be provided by the domain bias. Therefore, we investigate the effect of domain bias on the model with liver ultrasound imaging data obtained from multiple domains. We have constructed a dataset considering the manufacturer and the year of manufacturing of 8 ultrasound imaging machines. First, training and testing were performed by dividing the entire data, in a commonly used method. Second, we have utilized the training data constructed according to the number of domains for the machine learning process. Then we have measured and compared the performance on internal and external domain data. Through the above experiment, we have analyzed the effect of domains of data on model performance. We show that the performance scores evaluated with the internal domain data and the external domain data do not match. We especially show that the performance measured in the evaluation data including the internal domain was much higher than the performance measured in the evaluation data consisting of the external domain. We also show that 3-level classification performance is slightly improved over 5-level classification by mitigating class imbalance by integrating similar classes. The results highlight the need to develop a new methodology for mitigating the machine bias problem so that the model can work correctly even on external domain data, as opposed to the usual approach of constructing evaluation data in the same domain as the training data. © 2013 IEEE.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SciRep</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automated estimation of cancer cell deformability with machine learning and acoustic trapping</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lim-lab" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hae Gyun Lim</a>, K.

Existing methods commonly inflict pressure on cells and observe changes in cell areas, diameters, or thickness according to the degree of pressure. Then, the Young’s moduli (i.e., a measure of deformability) of cells are estimated based on the assumption that the degrees of the changes are inversely proportional to Young’s moduli. However, manual measurements of the physical changes in cells are labor-intensive, and the subjectivity of the operators can intervene during this step, thereby causing considerable uncertainty. Further, because the shapes of cells are nonuniform, we cannot ensure the assumption for linear correlations of physical changes in cells with their deformability. Therefore, this study aims at measuring non-linear elastic moduli of live cells (degrees of cell deformability) automatically by employing conventional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) while preserving (or enhancing) the accuracy of the manual methods. First, we obtain photomicrographs of cells on multiple pressure levels using single-beam acoustic tweezers, and then, we suggest an image preprocessing method for emphasizing changes in cell areas on the photomicrographs. The CNN model is trained to measure the ratios of the cell area change at each pressure level. Then, we apply the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the correlations of the cell area change ratios according to the pressure levels with cell deformability. The accuracy of the CNN was evaluated using two types of breast cancer cells: MDA-MB-231 (invasive) and MCF-7 (noninvasive). The MLP was assessed using five different beads (Young’s moduli from 0.214 to 9.235 kPa), which provides standardized reference data of the non-linear elastic moduli of live cells. Finally, we validated the practicality of the proposed system by examining whether the non-linear elastic moduli estimated by the proposed system can distinguish invasive breast cancer cells from noninvasive ones. © 2022, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Sensors</abbr> </div> <div id="Jeon2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Day-Ahead Hourly Solar Irradiance Forecasting Based on Multi-Attributed Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://higd963.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hyeon-Ju Jeon</a> , Min-Woo Choi , and <em>O-Joun Lee</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Sensors</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.3390/s22197179" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Solar irradiance forecasting is fundamental and essential for commercializing solar energy generation by overcoming output variability. Accurate forecasting depends on historical solar irradiance data, correlations between various meteorological variables (e.g., wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness), and influences between the weather contexts of spatially adjacent regions. However, existing studies have been limited to spatiotemporal analysis of a few variables, which have clear correlations with solar irradiance (e.g., sunshine duration), and do not attempt to establish atmospheric contextual information from a variety of meteorological variables. Therefore, this study proposes a novel solar irradiance forecasting model that represents atmospheric parameters observed from multiple stations as an attributed dynamic network and analyzes temporal changes in the network by extending existing spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) models. By comparing the proposed model with existing models, we also investigated the contributions of (i) the spatial adjacency of the stations, (ii) temporal changes in the meteorological variables, and (iii) the variety of variables to the forecasting performance. We evaluated the performance of the proposed and existing models by predicting the hourly solar irradiance at observation stations in the Korean Peninsula. The experimental results showed that the three features are synergistic and have correlations that are difficult to establish using single-aspect analysis. © 2022 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SciRep</abbr> </div> <div id="Jeon2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automated cell-type classification combining dilated convolutional neural networks with label-free acoustic sensing</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://higd963.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hyeon-Ju Jeon</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lim-lab" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hae Gyun Lim</a>, K.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that label-free acoustic sensing using high-frequency ultrasound at a high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) can capture and analyze a single object from a heterogeneous sample. However, eliminating possible errors in the manual setting and time-consuming processes when postprocessing integrated backscattering (IB) coefficients of backscattered signals is crucial. In this study, an automated cell-type classification system that combines a label-free acoustic sensing technique with deep learning-empowered artificial intelligence models is proposed. We applied an one-dimensional (1D) convolutional autoencoder to denoise the signals and conducted data augmentation based on Gaussian noise injection to enhance the robustness of the proposed classification system to noise. Subsequently, denoised backscattered signals were classified into specific cell types using convolutional neural network (CNN) models for three types of signal data representations, including 1D CNN models for waveform and frequency spectrum analysis and two-dimensional (2D) CNN models for spectrogram analysis. We evaluated the proposed system by classifying two types of cells (e.g., RBC and PNT1A) and two types of polystyrene microspheres by analyzing their backscattered signal patterns. We attempted to discover cell physical properties reflected on backscattered signals by controlling experimental variables, such as diameter and structure material. We further evaluated the effectiveness of the neural network models and efficacy of data representations by comparing their accuracy with that of baseline methods. Therefore, the proposed system can be used to classify reliably and precisely several cell types with different intrinsic physical properties for personalized cancer medicine development. © 2022, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Comp4Human</abbr> </div> <div id="Vo20211" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Computing4Human 2021: The 2nd international conference on human-centered artificial intelligence</div> <div class="author"> Nam D.

Thus, supporting joint research between multiple institutes, we have to consider not only synergies between scholars but also purposes of the institutes. To solve this problem, we propose a bibliographic network embedding method that can learn characteristics of institutes, not only of each scholar. First, we compose a bibliographic network that consists of scholars, publications, venues, research projects, and institutes. Collaboration styles and research topics of institutes and scholars are extracted by mining subgraphs from the bibliographic network. Then, vector representations of network nodes are learned based on occurrences of subgraphs on the nodes and neighborhoods of the nodes. Based on the vector representations, we train multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to assess collaboration probability between scholars affiliated in different institutes. For training the MLP, we suggest three strategies: (i) considering every collaboration, (ii) focusing on interinstitutional collaborations, and (iii) focusing on collaboration outcomes. To evaluate the proposed methods, we have analyzed research collaborations of POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology) and RIST (Research Institute of Industrial Science and Technology) from 2011 to 2020.

Bibliographic network structures rooted in the entities are incredibly diverse, and this diversity increases in the outstanding entities. Thus, despite their significant volume, the outstanding entities obtain minimal learning opportunities, whereas low-performance entities are over-represented. This study solves the problem by representing the patterns of the entities rather than depicting individual entities in a precise manner. First, we describe structures rooted in the entities using the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) relabeling process. Each subgraph generated by the relabeling process provides information on the scholars, kinds of papers they published, standards of venues in which the papers were published, and types of their collaborators. We assume that a subgraph depicts the research patterns of bibliographic entities, such as the preference of a scholar in choosing either a few highly impactful papers or numerous papers of moderate impact. Then, we simplify the subgraphs according to multiple levels of detailedness. Original subgraphs represent the individuality of the entities, and simplified subgraphs represent the entities sharing the same research patterns. In addition, simplified subgraphs balance the learning opportunities of high- and low-performance entities by co-occurring with both types of entities. We embed the subgraphs using the Skip-Gram method. If the results of the embedding represent the research patterns of the entities, the obtained vectors should be able to represent various aspects of the research performance in both the short-term and long-term durations regardless of the performances of the entities. Therefore, we conducted experiments for predicting 23 performance indicators during four time periods for four performance groups (top 1%, 5%, 10%, and all entities) using only the vector representations. The proposed model outperformed the existing network embedding methods in terms of both accuracy and variance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">AppSci</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee20211" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Plot structure decomposition in narrative multimedia by analyzing personalities of fictional characters</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, <a href="https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/esyou" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eun-Soon You</a>, and Jin-Taek Kim </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</em>, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.3390/app11041645" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This study aims to decompose plot structures of stories in narrative multimedia (i.e., creative works that contain stories and are distributed through multimedia). Since a story is interwoven with main plots and subplots (i.e., primary and ancillary story lines), decomposing a story into multiple story lines enables us to analyze how events in the story are allocated and logically connected. For the decomposition, the existing studies employed character networks (i.e., social networks of characters that appeared in a story) and assumed that characters’ social relationships are consistent in a story line. However, these studies overlooked that social relationships significantly change around major events. To solve this problem, we attempt to use the changes for distinguishing story lines rather than suffer from the changes. We concentrate on the changes in characters’ social relationships being the result of changes in their personalities. Moreover, these changes gradually proceed within a story line. Therefore, we first propose features for measuring changes in personalities of characters: (i) Degrees of characters in character networks, (ii) lengths of dialogues spoken by characters, and (iii) ratios of out-degrees for in-degrees of characters in character networks. We supposed these features reflect importance, inner/outer conflicts, and activeness of characters, respectively. Since characters’ personalities gradually change in a story line, we can suppose that the features also show gradual story developments in a story line. Therefore, we conduct regression for each feature to discover dominant tendencies of the features. By filtering scenes that do not follow the tendencies, we extract a story line that exhibits the most dominant personality changes. We can decompose stories into multiple story lines by iterating the regression and filtering. Besides, personalities of characters change more significantly in major story lines. Based on this assumption, we also propose methods for discriminating main plots.

In this paper, we first present a definition of the citation context and initialize the embedding vector based on the citation order and location. Then, based on the graph transformer model, we learn contextual citation embeddings. To represent citation context, we consider the following three parts: (i) textual features of paper, (ii) positional features of the citation context, and (iii) structural features of the citation network by applying the self-attention mechanism. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

To describe incidents in stories, directors use the techniques as like as visual language. Thus, visual storytelling techniques used in a shot should be correlated with incidents shown by the shot. In this study, we first present various taxonomies of the visual storytelling techniques and discuss which techniques have more correlations with conflicts than the others. Then, based on usages of the techniques in each shot, we measure intensity of conflicts described by the shot. Finally, we validated correlations of visual storytelling techniques with stories’ content by examining correlations of the proposed conflict measurement with conflict degrees annotated by scholars and practitioners in film studies.

We discretize the interactions by discovering the subgraphs and learn representations of stories by predicting occurrences of the subgraphs in corresponding character networks. We find subgraphs rooted in each character on each scene in multiple scales, using the WL (Weisfeiler-Lehman) relabeling process.

Also, if a metaphorical symbol is significant for storytelling, the symbol will appear on most of the scenes. Therefore, we find groups of entities, which share similar lexical meanings and appear allover the movie.

Particularly, the main research focuses on how the network configuration can be automatically and adaptively decided, given various dynamic contexts (e.g., network interference, heterogeneity and so on). Specifically, we design a context-based data-driven framework for network operation in connected environment which includes three layer architecture: (i) network entity layer; (ii) complex semantic analytics layer and (iii) action provisioning layer.

Vector representations of stories enable us to compare narrative works regardless of their media or formats. To computationally represent stories, we focus on social networks among characters (character networks). We assume that the structural features of the character networks reflect the characteristics of stories. By extending substructure-based graph embedding models, we propose models to learn distributed representations of character networks in stories. The proposed models consist of three parts: (i) discovering substructures of character networks, (ii) embedding each substructure (Char2Vec), and (iii) learning vector representations of each character network (Story2Vec). We find substructures around each character in multiple scales based on proximity between characters. We suppose that a character’s substructures signify its ‘social roles’. Subsequently, a Char2Vec model is designed to embed a social role based on co-occurred social roles. Since character networks are dynamic social networks that temporally evolve, we use temporal changes and adjacency of social roles to determine their co-occurrence. Finally, Story2Vec models predict occurrences of social roles in each story for embedding the story. To predict the occurrences, we apply two approaches: (i) considering temporal changes in social roles as with the Char2Vec model and (ii) focusing on the final social roles of each character. We call the embedding model with the first approach ‘flow-oriented Story2Vec.’ This approach can reflect the context and flow of stories if the dynamics of character networks is well understood. Second, based on the final states of social roles, we can emphasize the denouement of stories, which is an overview of the static structure of the character networks. We name this model as ‘denouement-oriented Story2Vec.’ In addition, we suggest ‘unified Story2Vec’ as a combination of these two models. We evaluated the quality of vector representations generated by the proposed embedding models using movies in the real world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Cancers</abbr> </div> <div id="Lim2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Classification of breast cancer cells using the integration of high-frequency single-beam acoustic tweezers and convolutional neural networks</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lim-lab" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hae Gyun Lim</a>, <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, K.

Recently, the characterization of a single cancer cell using high-frequency (&gt;30 MHz) SBAT has been reported to determine its invasiveness and metastatic potential. Investigation of cell elasticity and invasiveness is based on the deformability of cells under SBAT’s radiation forces, and in general, more physically deformed cells exhibit higher levels of invasiveness and therefore higher metastatic potential. However, previous imaging analysis to determine substantial differences in cell deformation, where the SBAT is turned ON or OFF, relies on the subjective observation that may vary and requires follow-up evaluations from experts. In this study, we propose an automatic and reliable cancer cell classification method based on SBAT and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which provides objective and accurate quantitative measurement results. We used a custom-designed 50 MHz SBAT transducer to obtain a series of images of deformed human breast cancer cells. CNN-based classification methods with data augmentation applied to collected images determined and validated the metastatic potential of cancer cells. As a result, with the selected optimizers, precision, and recall of the model were found to be greater than 0.95, which highly validates the classification performance of our integrated method. CNN-guided cancer cell deformation analysis using SBAT may be a promising alternative to current histological image analysis, and this pretrained model will significantly reduce the evaluation time for a larger population of cells. © 2020 by the authors.

Various methods for story-based summarization have been proposed as a practical application of the character network analysis (i.e., a social network among characters that appeared in a story). However, the existing methods do not consider that summaries have different requirements according to their types (e.g., trailers, highlights, and recaps). These methods consist of three parts: (i) discretizing narrative works into regular units (e.g., scenes or shots), (ii) measuring the narrative significance of each unit, and (iii) generating summaries based on the narrative significance. Most of the existing studies have proposed their unique significance measurements based on individual narrative features. Also, since these methods have not considered the diverse types of summaries, they have simply selected top-N narrative units according to the measurements. In this study, we first introduce and redefine the narrative significance measurements. Subsequently, we propose a method for summarizing a narrative work regarding the requirements of the summaries by integrating the various significance measurements. © 2020 ACM.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Comp4Human</abbr> </div> <div id="Kim20201" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Computing4Human 2020: The 1st international workshop on computational humanities and social sciences</div> <div class="author"> Jin-Taek Kim , <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jason J.

We measure the narrative fluency based on whether relationships between entities in the narrative (i.e., subjects and objects of events that compose the narrative) are consistently described with adequate rapidity. The relationships are represented by a dynamic interaction network (called ’entity network’), which has entities as nodes and co-occurrences between the entities as edges. Lack of consistency makes users confused about what the textual narratives want to present. If a narrative consistently concentrates on a topic or subject, its entity network will have few entities with high node centrality. Using consistency of the high centrality entities, we assess the fluency with three criteria: (i) consistency in each paragraph, (ii) consistency in the overall narrative, and (iii) consistency between the title and body. The rapidity of narrative development has to be appropriate for expected readers of the textual narratives. Too low rapidity causes redundancy, and high rapidity hinders the under-standability of the narratives. We assume structural changes in the entity network reflect the narrative rapidity. The structural change is measured by embedding structures of the entity network. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed methods using the editorials of the New York Times and human evaluators.

Since one of the primary purposes in the subculture consumption is vicarious satisfaction, the subculture works straightforwardly describe what their readers want to achieve and break down. The latent desires and conflicts are useful for understanding our society and realizing smart governance. To discover the social issues, we concentrate on that each subculture genre has a unique imaginary world that consists of inventive subjects. We suppose that the subjects correspond to individual social issues. For example, game fiction, one of the popular genres, describes a world like video games. Under game systems, everyone gets the same results for the same efforts, and it can be interpreted as critics for the social inequality issue. Therefore, we first extract subjects of genres and measure the membership degrees of subculture works for each genre. Using the subjects and membership degrees, we build a genealogy tree of subculture genres by tracing their evolution and differentiation. Then, we extract social issues by searching for the subjects that come from the real world, not imaginary. If a subculture work criticizes authoritarianism, it might include subjects such as government officials and bureaucrats. A combination of the social issues and genre genealogy tree will show diachronic changes in our society. We have evaluated the proposed methods by extracting social issues reflected in Korean web novels. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the existing studies aimed to embed only stories in a narrative work. By covering other granularity levels, we can easily compare narrative utterances that are coarser (e.g., movie series) or finer (e.g., scenes) than a narrative work. We apply the multi-layered structures on learning hierarchical representations of the narrative utterances. To represent coarser utterances, we consider adjacency and appearance of finer utterances in the coarser ones. For the movies, we suppose a four-layered structure (character roles ∈ characters ∈ scenes ∈ movies) and propose three learning methods bridging the layers: Char2Vec, Scene2Vec, and Hierarchical Story2Vec. Char2Vec represents a character by using dynamic changes in the character’s roles. To find the character roles, we use substructures of character networks (i.e., dynamic social networks of characters). A scene describes an event. Interactions between characters in the scene are designed to describe the event. Scene2Vec learns representations of a scene from interactions between characters in the scene. A story is a series of events. Meanings of the story are affected by order of the events as well as their content. Hierarchical Story2Vec uses sequential order of scenes to represent stories. The proposed model has been evaluated by estimating the similarity between narrative utterances in real movies. © 2020 by the authors.

Based upon our previous studies regarding ‘character networks’ (i.e., social networks among characters in the stories), we elicited the stories with three methods: (i) composing affective character networks with affective relationships among the characters, (ii) measuring temporal changes in tension according to the flows of the stories, and (iii) detecting affective events which refer to dramatic changes in the tension. The affective relationships contain emotional changes of the characters on each segment of the stories. By aggregating the characters’ emotional changes, we measured the tension of each segment. We called it ‘Affective Fluctuation’ and represented it as a discrete function (Affective Fluctuation Function, AFF). The AFFs enable us to detect affective events by using gradients of them and measure similarities among the stories by comparing their shapes. Also, we proposed a computational model of the stories by annotating the affective events and characters involved in those events. Finally, we demonstrated a practical application with a recommendation method which exploited the similarities between stories. Additionally, we verified the reliabilities and efficiencies of the proposed method for narrative works in the real world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">FDATA</abbr> </div> <div id="Jeon2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Is Performance of Scholars Correlated to Their Research Collaboration Patterns?</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://higd963.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hyeon-Ju Jeon</a>, <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, and <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jason J.

Although the most straightforward approaches are centrality measurements or community detection, scholars mostly participate in multiple research groups and have different roles in each group. Thus, we concentrate on the subgraphs of co-authorship networks rooted in each scholar that cover (i) overlapping of the research groups on the scholar and (ii) roles of the scholar in the groups. This study calls the subgraphs “collaboration patterns” and applies subgraph embedding methods to discover and represent the collaboration patterns. Based on embedding the collaboration patterns, we have clustered scholars according to their collaboration styles. Then, we have examined whether scholars in each cluster have similar research performance, using the quantitative indicators. The coherence of the indicators cannot be solid proofs for validating the correlation between collaboration and performance. Nevertheless, the examination for clusters has exhibited that the collaboration patterns can reflect research styles of scholars. This information will enable us to predict the research performance more accurately since the research styles are more consistent and sustainable features of scholars than a few high-impact publications.

By combining multiple data sources (e.g., the text, video, and audio), we attempted to enhance the accuracy and semantic richness of existing character networks that confine themselves to a particular data source. To merge various data, we propose story synchronization for (i) improving the accuracy of data extracted from the narrative multimedia and (ii) integrating the data into the unified character network. The story synchronization mainly consists of three steps: synchronizing (i) scenes, (ii) characters, and (iii) character networks. First, we synchronize dialogues in the text and audio, to discover speakers and time of dialogues. This enables us to segment the scene using time periods when dialogues (in the text and audio) and characters (in the video) do not commonly occur. Through the scene segmentation, we can discretize stories in the narrative work. By comparing the occurrence of dialogues and characters in each scene, we synchronize identities of the characters in the text and video (e.g., names and faces of characters). Thereby, we can more accurately estimate participants and time of a conversation between characters (i.e., a set of connected dialogues). Based on the conversation, the existing character networks are refined and integrated into the unified character network. In addition, we verified the efficacy of the proposed methods using movies in the real world, which are among the most accessible and popular narrative multimedia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">WIMS</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Character network embedding-based plot structure discovery in narrative multimedia</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, and <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jason J.

Although a few studies have been conducted to extract subplots from narrative works based on occurrences of characters, the subplots do not always have distinctive compositions of characters. Therefore, we propose a method for discriminating the subplots based on overall social relationships among characters. To understand ways how a story is interwoven with subplots, it is important to describe how story lines in each subplot are developed and how subplots are split and rearranged. As a first step, we propose a measurement for estimating rapidity of story development based on changes in the social relationships among characters. Subsequently, we suggest a model for representing plot structures based on transitions among subplots, the narrative significance of each scene, and the main characters of each subplot.

Therefore recommender systems for the sharing economy services are required. However, the existing recommenders are hard to support the sharing economy services, since they have focused on a ‘Item-User’ model that the recommenders provide satisfiable items to consumers (users) in accordance with only the consumers’ preferences. In this regard, we suggest a novel recommendation model, ‘Owner-Borrower’ model which considers the preferences of both sides: owners and borrowers of properties (items). Also, we propose a recommendation method based on the proposed model by applying a tensor factorization method and the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The tensor factorization is used for estimating preferences of the owners and the borrowers. With the estimated preferences, the Gale-Shapley algorithm makes optimal matches between the borrowers and the owners’ properties. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">JUCS</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee2018322" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Multi-scaled spatial analytics on discovering latent social events for smart urban services</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, Yunhu Kim , Hoang Long Nguyen , and <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jai E.

The latent social event indicates a regional and inconspicuous social event which is mostly buried under macroscopic trends or issues. To detect the latent social event, we propose three methods: i) discovering areas-of-interest (AOIs), ii) allocating social texts to the AOIs, and iii) detecting social events in each AOI. The AOIs can be composed by grouping social texts which are topically and spatially homogeneous. To make the AOIs dynamic and incremental, we use windows for allocating a social text to an adequate AOI. Lastly, the latent social events are detected from the AOI on the basis of keywords and temporal distribution of the social texts. Although, in this study, we limited the proposed method into analyzing social media, it could be extended to detecting events among agents/things/sensors. © J.UCS.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">CCPE</abbr> </div> <div id="Park2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Spatio-temporal query contextualization for microtext retrieval in social media</div> <div class="author"> Jae-Hong Park , <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, and <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jai E.

Furthermore, based on a two-way learning approach, the proposed method is able to support automated regular or occasional rule updates. It makes self-adaptive CEP system possible by combining the rule generation method and the existing dynamic CEP systems. This technique is verified by establishing an automated stock trading system, and the performance of the system is measured in terms of the rate of return.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to summarize a movie based on character network analysis and the appearance of protagonist and main characters in the movie. Experiments were carried out for 2 movies (Titanic (1997) and Frozen (2013)) to show that our method outperforms conventional approaches in terms of the movie summarization rate. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">APH</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee2016179" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Adaptive collaborative filtering based on scalable clustering for big recommender systems</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, Min-Sung Hong , <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jason J.

It is difficult for model-based CF methods to address the scalability-performance trade-off. Therefore, we propose a scalable clustering-based CF method in this paper that can help provide a balance by re-locating elements in the cluster model. The proposed method is evaluated by performing a comparison against existing methods in terms of measurements for the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and response time to assess the performance and scalability. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the MAE and the response time by 50.79% and 48.25%, respectively. © 2016, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

The resulting congestion has become a key issue and emerging research topic to transportation specialist and decision makers. In this study, inspired by recent advanced vehicle technologies, we take into account in improving traffic flow in real-time problem. In order to solve the problem, we propose a new approach to manage traffic flow at the intersection in real-time via controlling by traffic light scheduling. In particular, the proposed method is based on process synchronization theory and connected vehicle technology where each vehicle is able to communicate with others. The traffic deadlock is also taken into consideration in case of high traffic volume.

Thereby, an efficient recommendation services are needed. However, since the existing recommendation method (e.g. collaborative filtering) has two fundamental problems: (i.e., data sparsity and scalability problem), it has difficulties with reflecting users’ personality. In this paper, we propose the MBTI-CF method to solve these problems and to involve users’ personality by building personality-based neighborhood using MBTI. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted statistical testing by user survey (anonymous users have rated set of the pre-selected Webtoon contents). Three experimental results have shown that MBTI-CF provides improvement in terms of the data sparsity problem and the scalability problem and offers more stable performance. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ACIIDS</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee2015430" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Adaptive complex event processing based on collaborative rule mining engine</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, <a href="https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/esyou" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eunsoon You</a>, Min-Sung Hong , and <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jason J.

However, it lowers the reliability of a system as the set of rules defined by an expert changes along with dynamic changes in the domain environment. A human error made by an expert is another factor that may undermine the reliability of the system. In an effort to address such problems, this study introduces Collaborative Rule Mining Engine (CRME) designed to automatically mine rules based on the history of decisions made by a domain expert by adopting a collaborative filtering approach, which is effective in mimicking and predicting human decision-making in an environment where there are sufficient data or information to do so. Furthermore, this study suggests an adaptive CEP technique, which does not hamper the reliability since it prevents potential errors caused by mistakes of domain experts and adapts to changes in the domain environment on its own as it is linked to the system proposed by Bharagavi [10]. In a bid to verify this technique, an automated stocks trading system will be established and its performance will be measured using the rate of return. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">CYBCONF</abbr> </div> <div id="Lee201548" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predictive Clustering for performance stability in collaborative filtering techniques</div> <div class="author"> <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, <a href="http://intelligent.pe.kr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jason J.

Such tradeoff results in reduced coverage, which is one sort of the sparsity issue. Furthermore, high model building costs lead to unstable performance driven by cumulative changes in the domain environment. To solve these problems, we propose Predictive Clustering-based CF (PCCF) that incorporates the Markov model and fuzzy clustering with Clustering based CF (CBCF). The method improves performance instability by tracking the changes in user preferences and bridging the gap between the static model and dynamic users. Furthermore, the issue of reduced coverage is also improved by expanding the coverage based on transition probabilities. The proposed method has been validated by testing the robustness of performance instability and scalability-performance tradeoff. In comparison with the existing techniques, the suggested method shows slight performance improvement. Notwithstanding, it is more advanced than the existing techniques in terms of the range that indicates the level of performance fluctuation. This signifies that the proposed method, despite the slight performance improvement, clearly offers better performance stability compared to the existing techniques. © 2015 IEEE.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Inform</abbr> </div> <div id="Hong20145597" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Meta-data configuration and learning technique for wellness content recommendation</div> <div class="author"> Min-Sung Hong , <em>O-Joun Lee</em>, Won-Jin Lee , Kee-Won Kim , Seung-Hoon Kim , Hee-Jung Han , and Jae-Dong Lee </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Information</em>, 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-pmid="" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The method for personalized wellness-content recommendation has actively studied in the field of information technology convergence. But a problem with low reliability of recommendations has emerged. Because existing studies deal with only one or two areas of wellness, to solve the reliability problems, a study is needed into an integration technique that can manage several aspects of wellness. In this paper, we propose a metadata configuration and feature analysis technique for integrated management in areas of wellness. And we propose a learning technique for analyzed wellness features using user feedback to increase the reliability of user recommendations. To verify the proposed technique, we compared the results of a pre-survey with those from the proposed technique. © 2014 International Information Institute.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 O-Joun Lee.
